    Evaluates a policy on a given MDP.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    mdp: the environment to use in the evaluation
    policy: the policy to evaluate
    criterion: either 'discounted' or 'average'
    n_episodes: the number of episodes to generate in the evaluation
    initial_states: either None (i), a numpy array (ii), or a list of numpy arrays (iii)
      - (i) initial states are drawn from the MDP distribution
      - (ii) the given array is used as initial state for all episodes
      - (iii) n_episodes is ignored and the episodes are defined by their initial states
    n_threads: the number of threads to use in the evaluation
    
    Returns
    -------
    The mean of the scores and its confidence interval.
